# C - Binary trees

This project involves learning about binary trees, their variations, advantages, and traversal methods, while adhering to specified guidelines and utilizing provided data structures.

# Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

# 0. New node

  + <u>[0-binary_tree_node.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/0-binary_tree_node.c)</u>: C function that creates a binary tree node.

  + Return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.

# 1. Insert left

  + <u>[1-binary_tree_insert_left.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/1-binary_tree_insert_left.c)</u>: C function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node.

  + If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

  + Return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL.

# 2. Insert right

  + <u>[2-binary_tree_insert_right.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/2-binary_tree_insert_right.c)</u>: C function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node.

  + If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.

  + Return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL.

# 3. Delete

  + <u>[3-binary_tree_delete.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/3-binary_tree_delete.c)</u>: C function that deletes an entire binary tree.

# 4. Is leaf

  + <u>[4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c)</u>: C function that checks if a node is a leaf.

# 5. Is root

  + <u>[5-binary_tree_is_root.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/5-binary_tree_is_root.c)</u>: C function that checks if a given node is a root.

  + Return 1 if node is a root, otherwise 0.

# 6. Pre-order traversal

  + <u>[6-binary_tree_preorder.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/6-binary_tree_preorder.c)</u>: C function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal.

# 7. In-order traversal

  + <u>[7-binary_tree_inorder.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/7-binary_tree_inorder.c)</u>: C function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal.

# 8. Post-order traversal

  + <u>[8-binary_tree_postorder.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/8-binary_tree_postorder.c)</u>: C function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal.

# 9. Height

  + <u>[9-binary_tree_height.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/9-binary_tree_height.c)</u>: C function that measures the height of a binary tree.

# 10. Depth

  + <u>[10-binary_tree_depth.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/10-binary_tree_depth.c)</u>: C function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.

# 11. Size

  + <u>[11-binary_tree_size.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/11-binary_tree_size.c)</u>: C function that measures the size of a binary tree.

# 12. Leaves

  + <u>[12-binary_tree_leaves.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/12-binary_tree_leaves.c)</u>: C function that counts the leaves in a binary tree.

# 13. Nodes

  + <u>[13-binary_tree_nodes.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/13-binary_tree_nodes.c)</u>: C function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree.

# 14. Balance factor

  + <u>[14-binary_tree_balance.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/binary_trees/blob/master/14-binary_tree_balance.c)</u>: C function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree.
